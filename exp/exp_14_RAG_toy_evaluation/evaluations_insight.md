    RIGHT ANSWER:
       1. To calculate the mean net profit margin for Best Buy for the fiscal years 2015, 2016, and 2017, we need to divide the net earnings from continuing operations by the revenue for each year and then calculate the average.

       For 2015: Net earnings from continuing operations: $1,246 million Revenue: $40,339 million Net profit margin: (1,246 / 40,339) * 100 = 3.1%

       For 2016: Net earnings from continuing operations: $807 million Revenue: $39,528 million Net profit margin: (807 / 39,528) * 100 = 2.0%

       For 2017: Net earnings from continuing operations: $1,207 million Revenue: $39,403 million Net profit margin: (1,207 / 39,403) * 100 = 3.1%

       To calculate the mean net profit margin, we add up the net profit margins for each year and divide by the number of years: (3.1 + 2.0 + 3.1) / 3 = 2.7%

       Therefore, the mean net profit margin for Best Buy for the fiscal years 2015, 2016, and 2017 is 2.7%. SOURCES: Company: BESTBUY, SEC report: 10K
