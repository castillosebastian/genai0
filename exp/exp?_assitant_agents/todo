Warnings:

"While GPT models that have been finetuned for function-calling still require a parser to verify outputs as valid function syntax, we observed that GPT-4 function fine-tuned models rarely made syntactic or semantic errors on the MemGPT function set, whereas GPT-3.5 finetuned models consistently generated incorrect function calls, or used attempted to use functions incorrectly. Similarly, we also found that the most popular the Llama 2 70B model variants (even those fine-tuned for function calling) would consistently generate incorrect function calls or even hallucinate functions outside the providede schema. At present reasonable performance is only achieved using specialized GPT-4 models". cfr.MemGPT, pag.13.-
